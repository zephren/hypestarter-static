                We are constantly adding to our plugin library, that means the
                longer your account is active, the more features you will have
                access to. Not to worry, we guarantee that your sign up price is
                locked in for the entire life of your Hypestarter account.

                If you decide that a different Hypestarter plan is a better fit,
                you can change your active plan at any time from your settings
                page. Once changed, you will receive a prorated charge or a
                refund depending on the price difference.

                access to every available plugin free for 30 days (no credit
                card required). Once you’ve had time to assess which plugins are
                right for you, simply choose the appropriate plan at the end of
                the month.

                All Hypestarter plans are paid either monthly or yearly. Many of
